# Globebank PHP Course from Lynda.com

This site is the project created from the course PHP with MySQL Essential Training: 1 The Basics

Updates will happen as I progress through the course.

10/27/2017 - The content of the pages takes styling and layout directly from the course instructions. The stylesheet I just dropped in from  the course files rather than creating it (not something I have experience with). For now, I'm focusing on reinforcing the concepts of generating the provided html sections dynamically with PHP as well as learning the MySQL connection docs. A question I'll be researching: In the course, the MySQL credentials are stored in a file that's not publicly accessible from the site tree. This seems unsecure. Is there a better practice/best practice for storing these credentials?
